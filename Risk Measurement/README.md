## 1. Value-at-Risk (VaR)

**Value-at-Risk (VaR)** is one of the most widely used statistical measures for assessing the potential loss in value of a portfolio or asset over a defined time horizon, under normal market conditions, and at a given confidence level.

- **Definition**: VaR provides the maximum potential loss that will not be exceeded with a given level of confidence over a specified time period.

- **Calculation Methods**:
  - **Parametric (Variance-Covariance)**: Assumes normal distribution of returns.
  - **Historical Simulation**: Uses actual historical return data.
