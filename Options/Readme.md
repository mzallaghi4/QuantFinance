### Greeks Calculation for European Options

Calculation og the Greeks (risk metrics) for European call and put options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. 
The Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) help traders and analysts understand how option prices react to changes in market variables such as the underlying asset price, volatility, time, and interest rates.


#### Greek Calculations
- Delta (Δ): Price sensitivity to underlying asset 
- Gamma (Γ): Delta sensitivity to underlying price
- Theta (Θ): Time decay sensitivity
- Vega (ν): Volatility sensitivity
- Rho (ρ): Interest rate sensitivity

##### Delta vs Spot Price
* Call Delta: Increases from 0 to 1 as spot price rises
* Put Delta: Decreases from 0 to -1 as spot price rises
* Kink at strike price (K=100) showing maximum sensitivity
