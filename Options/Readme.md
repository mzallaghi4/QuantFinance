### Greeks Calculation for European Options

Calculation og the Greeks (risk metrics) for European call and put options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. 
The Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) help traders and analysts understand how option prices react to changes in market variables such as the underlying asset price, volatility, time, and interest rates.


The project implements the Black-Scholes model for analytical Greeks and provides interactive visualizations for risk analysis.
