####  Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) for Stock Portfolio

Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), a key principle in modern portfolio theory (MPT) proposed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, aims to create a portfolio of assets (stocks) that maximizes expected returns for a specific level of risk or minimizes risk for a certain expected return.
The optimization process involves balancing two key factors:
1.	Expected Returns (Mean): The average return you expect to receive from the portfolio over a period of time.
2.	Risk (Variance or Standard Deviation): The degree of variation in the portfolio's returns, typically measured as the portfolioâ€™s variance or standard deviation.

####   Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Asset Allocation

Develop a portfolio management system that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically optimize asset allocation, maximize risk-adjusted returns, and adapt to volatile market conditions in real-time. 
The system aims to outperform traditional strategies (e.g., Markowitz mean-variance) by learning optimal trading policies from historical and live market data.
