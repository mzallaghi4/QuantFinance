## Portfolio Credit Risk

Portfolio Credit Risk is the potential loss a lender or financial institution faces from a group of loans or credit exposures due to the possibility that one or more borrowers might default on their payments.

- Probability of Default (PD): Likelihood that a borrower will default.
- Loss Given Default (LGD): Proportion of the exposure that is lost if default occurs.
- Exposure at Default (EAD): The outstanding amount exposed at the time of default.
- Correlation Between Exposures: How defaults in different loans might be related.
